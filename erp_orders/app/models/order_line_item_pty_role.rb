# of Transaction - we call this process Guiding a Transaction to an Account.

# It's an important process and it's handled by a TransactionRulesManager,
# which is so named to distinguish it from Transaction Managment Software
# like Tuxedo.
# In this case, we have an optional account reference here so that orders
# can be split across accounts.
