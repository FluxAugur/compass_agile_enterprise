The Agreements Engine implements model classes for storing Contracts and Agreements data, including
AgreementItems, which represent the terms of the Agreement. Contracts are a special case of Agreements,
specifically Agreements which are legal in nature. Agreements and Terms are often used as the execution
context of a rules engine to govern other behaviors of a system.
