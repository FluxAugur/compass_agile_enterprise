= ErpTxnsAndAccts

The Transactions and Accounts Engine implements the root classes for adding business transactions 
and accounts to parties. The key marker interface classes here are BizTxnEvent,
which represents a common interface for all manner of management accounting transactions,
and BixTxnAcctRoot, which is the root class for the accounting of transactions. CompassAE
uses separate structures for management and financial accounting.
